I need to put a lot of thoughts into time management and stick to it.
There's a lot more going into being a good coder than being able to code well.

I am going to work on what my typical days and weeks should look like once Mod1 starts. Then I will try to get myself (and my family) to the routine as much as possible before the class actually starts.

# I forgot the second part. Sorry
I need to speak up more, so that I can learn to verbally communicate better with other programmers.
